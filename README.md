## Project Description
This project replicates and extends a regression-based analysis of video game sales originally done in R. The aim is to make it fully reproducibility in python. 

## Project Overview
- Predict global video game sales using features such as critic scores, user scores, and game age.
- Apply and compare multiple regression models: **Linear Regression**, **KNN**, and **Decision Tree**.
- Evaluate models using **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **RÂ² Score**.
- Visualize correlations and distributions.
- Apply **cross-validation** to assess model generalization.
